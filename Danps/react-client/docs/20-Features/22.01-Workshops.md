# Workshops Feature

The **Workshops** feature allows users to view and manage workshops.

## Structure
Location: `src/features/workshops`

- **api/**: `workshopService.ts` handles CRUD operations (`search`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
- **components/**:
  - `WorkshopsPage.tsx`: The main view for this feature. It includes:
    - List of workshops.
    - Search functionality.
    - Form to create new workshops.
    - Pagination controls.

## Functionality

### List & Search
- Fetches workshops from the API based on `page`, `pageSize`, and `query`.
- Updates automatically when filters change.

### Create/Edit/Delete
- Protected operations requiring a valid access token.
- UI updates optimistically or re-fetches list after operations.
