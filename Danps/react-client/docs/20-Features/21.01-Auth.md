# 21.01 Authentication Feature

The authentication feature provides user registration, login, token management, and role-based access control.

## Overview
-   **API Path**: `/api/identity`
-   **Storage**: Tokens are stored in `localStorage` under keys `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
-   **Context**: `AuthContext` provides global access to user state and `hasRole` capability.

## Key Components
-   `Login.tsx`: User login form.
-   `Register.tsx`: User registration form.
-   `AuthContext.tsx`: Manages state and access control.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
We use a claim-based verification system. The token contains a `role` claim which is checked by the `hasRole` function.

### Roles
-   **Admin**: Full access (Create, Edit, Delete workshops).
-   **Instructor**: Can Create and Edit workshops.
-   **Student/User**: View only.

### Usage
```tsx
const { hasRole } = useAuth();

{hasRole("Admin") && <DeleteButton />}
```

## Security
-   Tokens are refreshed automatically every 14 minutes.
-   Passwords must match complexity rules (min 6 chars).
