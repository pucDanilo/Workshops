# Project Structure Organization Proposals

To keep your code clean and facilitate the expansion of new components and functionalities, we have adopted the **Feature-Based Structure**.

## Selected Architecture: Feature-Based Structure
Group files by **feature** or **domain** rather than by file type. This makes it easier to work on a specific feature (e.g., Auth, Workshops) without jumping between `pages`, `api`, and `components` folders.

### Structure
```
src/
  components/          
    ui/                # Shared/Generic UI components (Button, Input, Card)
  features/            # Feature modules
    auth/
      components/      # Auth-specific components (Login, Register)
      api/             # Auth API services
      context/         # Auth Context
      schemas/         # Validation schemas
    workshops/
      components/
      api/
  layouts/             # Layout components (MainLayout, BottomNav)
  types/               # Shared types
  routes/              # Main app routing
  App.tsx
```

**Pros:**
- **Scalable:** Easy to add new features without cluttering root folders.
- **Co-located:** Everything related to a feature is in one place.
- **Encapsulated:** Features can be easily removed or refactored.

## Alternative Options Considered

### Option 2: Enhanced Layered Structure
Keep the current structure but refine it by separating "dumb" UI components from "smart" page components and introducing a `layouts` folder.

### Option 3: Atomic Design (UI Focused)
Focuses heavily on component reusability by breaking them down into Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms.
