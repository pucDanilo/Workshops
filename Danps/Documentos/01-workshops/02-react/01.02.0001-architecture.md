Project Structure Organization Proposals
To keep your code clean and facilitate the expansion of new components and functionalities, I propose the following organizational structures.

Option 1: Feature-Based Structure (Recommended)
Group files by feature or domain rather than by file type. This makes it easier to work on a specific feature (e.g., Auth, Workshops) without jumping between pages, api, and components folders.

Structure
src/
  components/          # Shared/Generic UI components (Button, Input, Card)
  hooks/               # Shared hooks
  lib/                 # Third-party lib config (axios, etc.)
  features/            # Feature modules
    auth/
      components/      # Auth-specific components (LoginForm)
      api/             # Auth API services
      routes/          # Auth routes
      types/           # Auth types
      index.ts         # Public API of the feature
    workshops/
      components/
      api/
      types/
      index.ts
  layouts/             # Layout components (MainLayout, AuthLayout)
  pages/               # Page composition (importing from features)
  routes/              # Main app routing
  App.tsx
Pros:

Scalable: Easy to add new features without cluttering root folders.
Co-located: Everything related to a feature is in one place.
Encapsulated: Features can be easily removed or refactored.
Cons:

Slightly more nesting.
Option 2: Enhanced Layered Structure
Keep the current structure but refine it by separating "dumb" UI components from "smart" page components and introducing a layouts folder.

Structure
src/
  api/                 # All API services
  components/
    common/            # Reusable UI (Button, Input, Modal)
    layout/            # Layouts (Sidebar, Header, PageContainer)
    features/          # Feature-specific components (WorkshopList, LoginForm)
  context/             # Global state
  pages/               # Page components (views)
  hooks/               # Custom hooks
  utils/               # Helper functions
  validation/          # Schemas
Pros:

Familiar: Close to what you have now.
Simple: Less nesting than feature-based.
Cons:

Scattered: Related code (API, View, Logic) is separated by type.
Option 3: Atomic Design (UI Focused)
Focuses heavily on component reusability by breaking them down into Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms.

Structure
src/
  components/
    atoms/             # Button, Input, Icon, Label
    molecules/         # FormField, SearchBar
    organisms/         # LoginForm, WorkshopCard
    templates/         # Page layouts
    pages/             # Final pages
Pros:

Reusable: Excellent for building a design system.
Consistent: Enforces UI consistency.
Cons:

Complex: Can be overkill for logic-heavy apps.
Naming: Hard to decide what is a molecule vs organism.
Recommendation
I recommend Option 1 (Feature-Based) combined with a components/ui folder for shared atomic elements. This gives you the best of both worlds: modular features and a reusable design system.

Proposed Next Steps (if Option 1 is chosen):
Create src/components/ui and extract Button, Input, Card styles into React components.
Create src/layouts and move the 
Sidebar
/BottomNav logic there.
Create src/features/auth and src/features/workshops and migrate existing code.
